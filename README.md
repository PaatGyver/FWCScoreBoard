# FWCScoreBoard
FootballWorldCupScoreBoard

- I have tried to keep the solution as simple as possible, reducing it to a library of classes and unit tests that check the validity of the solution.

- No abstract classes, interfaces, rest api, web server or microservices where implemented.

- No matches state cause only playing matches appear on the board so as soon as they finish they get deleted.
